# CPP MODULES

These modules are designed to teach the basics and advanced concepts of object-oriented programming in C++.

### There is a brief description of each module:

CPP Module 00: Introduction to C++ (differences from C, creating simple classes, basic syntax).

CPP Module 01: Dynamic memory allocation, understanding destructors, and pointer manipulation.

CPP Module 02: Polymorphism, operator overloading, and type conversion.

CPP Module 03: Inheritance and advanced object-oriented design.

CPP Module 04: In-depth polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

CPP Module 05: Exception handling and advanced stream usage in C++.

CPP Module 06: Introduction to templates and generic programming.

CPP Module 07: Advanced templates and designing generic containers.

CPP Module 08: Advanced use of the STL (Standard Template Library) and algorithms.
